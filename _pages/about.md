Hi, I’m Madhusudan Agarwal, a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, where I’m pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science. My academic interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, parallel computing, and distributed systems, and I enjoy building scalable, efficient backend architectures.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, where I earned a B.Tech in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.

Previously, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at DealShare, where I built distributed microservices to handle over a million monthly requests and led key initiatives in system security and code quality. I’ve also interned at Becton Dickinson and Citrix Systems, where I focused on backend optimization, test automation, and streamlining workflows.

Some of my notable achievements include securing a global rank of 375 out of more than 8,000 participants in Google Kickstart, and an All India Rank of 844 in JEE Advanced 2019 among 0.2 million candidates.
