### Project Goals

- Deliver an integrated journaling solution for developers within VSCode.
- Enable quick logging of bugs, snippets, and ideas for easy future reference.
- Support both solo and team workflows via an embedded dashboard.
- Minimize workflow interruptions through an all-in-one extension.

---

### User Persona & Use Cases

- **Developers**: Seamless note and task tracking during coding sessions.
- **Teams**: Share project notes and decisions inside VSCode.
- **Collaborators**: Prefer documenting and managing issues without external tools.
- **Power users**: Need fast, intuitive capture and recall of information.

### Features

- **File Tagging**: Tag files directly in the navigation bar to quickly organize by category or status.
- **Task & Issues Dashboard**: Sidebar dashboard for daily notes, todo lists, and issue tracking.
- **Integrated Workflow**: Unified place for journaling, minimizing the need to leave the IDE.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated checks for code quality; rapid iteration.
- **Merged Codebases**: Harnessed the strengths of two mature plugins for improved functionality.

---

### Technical Overview

- Built with **TypeScript** and **Node.js**, using the VSCode extension API.
- Modular, extensible designâ€”future features like markdown notes and advanced dashboards can be added easily.
- CI/CD pipeline with ESlint for code checks.
- Careful dependency management for merging plugin codebases.

### CI/CD Pipeline

A robust CI/CD pipeline ensures every code change is checked, tested, and integrated. The pipeline includes:

- **Automated Linting:** Uses ESLint (`.github/workflows/eslint.yaml`) for style and standards.
- **Automated Build & Tests:** All changes trigger test runs (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) to verify features.
- **Code Review Integration:** PRs kick off checks before merge.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Passing changes are auto-merged & deployed for rapid iteration and reliability.

### Challenges & Solutions

- **Incomplete Source**: Original codebases were not feature-complete, requiring significant research and refactoring.
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Merging plugins led to versioning issues, solved by systematic dependency management.
- **Testing & Linting**: Started with super-lint and migrated to ESLint for advanced config.
- **Learning Curve**: Ramp-up required for VSCode plugin APIs and architecture.
